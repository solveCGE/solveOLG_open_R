# POLICY SHOCK SECTION
# ========================
# Note: it is typically easiest to introduce shocks to period-view variables
#       and then convert them to cohort-view variables using per2coh()

## tax shocks
# tauprof = tauprof*0+0.15                    # profit tax rate is set to 15%
# tauprof[10:tend] = tauprof[10:tend]*0+0.15  # profit tax rate is set to 15%, starting in 10 years (announced today)
# tauprof[1:10] = tauprof[1:10]*0+0.15        # profit tax rate is set to 15% temporarily for next 10 years
# tauWv = tauWv*1.02; tauWz = per2coh(tauWv)  # wage tax is increased by 2%

## delayed retirement (uncomment whole block)
# {rag[1:10] = seq(from=rag0,to=(rag0+2),length.out=10); rag[11:tend]=rag0+2
# notretv[] = 0; for (tt in 1:tend) {notretv[1:floor(rag[tt]),tt] = 1; notretv[floor(rag[tt])+1,tt] = rag[tt]-floor(rag[tt]);}
 # notretz = per2coh(notretv);}                    # effective retirement age is increased linearly by 2 years over the next 10 years

## pension cut
# pv = pv*0.95; pz = per2coh(pv) # pensions are cut by 5%

## productivity shocks
# thetav = thetav*1.02; thetaz = per2coh(thetav)                       # individual productivity increases permanently by 2%
# thetav[,1:30] = thetav[,1:30]*1.02; thetaz = per2coh(thetav)         # individual productivity increases by 2% in the next 30 years
# TFP = TFP*1.02                                                       # total factor productivity increases permanently by 2%
# TFP[1:50] = TFP[1:50]*1.02

## fertility shocks
# NB = NB*1.02             # 2% more newborns every year
NB[1:30] = NB[1:30] * 1.02 # 2% more newborns every year over next 50 years

## mortality shocks
gamv[60:nag, ] = 1 - (1 - gamv[60:nag, ]) * 0.9; gamv[nag, ] = 0; gamz = per2coh(gamv)  # reduction of old-age mortality by 10%

## shock to the initial capital stock
# K[1] = K0*0.95                                                       # 1% of capital stock is lost in first period

## change in targeted debt path
# DG[5:20] = seq(from=DG0,to=DG0*0.9,length.out=20-5+1); DG[21:tend] = DG0*0.9 # reduce public debt by 10% over 15 years starting in 5 years
